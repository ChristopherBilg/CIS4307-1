As meat is one of the most important items of American diet, its price
is a matter of moment to every housewife. Comparisons between the cost
of live animals and the price per pound of meat sometimes lead to the
conclusion that the existing margin is too wide and that possibly the
profits of the middleman are too large.

After fair analysis, the housewife realizes that a live animal is not
all meat and, furthermore, that the meat carcass is not all steaks and
rib roasts. A comparison, therefore, between the live cost of meat
animals per pound and the cost per pound of a tenderloin is misleading,
if it results in any conclusions relative to margins.

Then we must reckon with the wide difference in grades of meat. We
cannot correctly estimate the cost of a steak cut from a prime beef by
that of a steak from a grass-fed cow. There are several grades of meat,
depending upon the nature and feeding, each wholesome and nutritious,
but some demanding more special cooking than others.

About fifty-five per cent of a steer is meat; the remainder includes
the hide and various other by-products, which, except the hide, are
not worth in their primary state anywhere near as much per pound as
they cost alive. The fifty-five per cent of the animal which is meat
must, therefore, carry the greater portion of the original cost. That
is why a steer carcass might be sold by the packer for twenty cents
a pound and still fail to pay a profit, even though the live animal
cost the packer only twelve cents a pound. The casual observer, noting
a difference of eight cents a pound between the live animal and the
carcass, might say a sixty-six per cent increase in price is unduly
large; but a little deeper study develops that the return from the
carcass in this instance would fail to equal the amount paid for the
live steer.

When a retailer buys a carcass, he purchases neck meat as well as
loins; chucks as well as rounds. Portions of the carcass have to be
sold at or sometimes less than he paid per pound for the carcass.
The choice cuts necessarily have to make up for the losses on the
less desirable portions. It is not unreasonable, therefore, that the
retailer should charge fifty or sixty cents a pound for choice steaks
and fifteen cents a pound for boiling beef out of a carcass which he
bought at the rate of twenty cents a pound.

Only the aggregate price which the retailer gets for all parts and
portions of the carcass will show his margin over the initial cost.
It is wholly improper, therefore, to compare sixty-cent steaks with
twelve-cent cattle with a view to determining profit.

The same thing is true of hogs and of sheep. A hog is not all meat, nor
is the meat all ham. A sheep is not all carcass and only a small part
of the carcass cuts up into chops. One must know the aggregate return
and something about the costs of doing business before a justifiable
conclusion as to price margins can be determined.




THE BUSINESS OF BEING A HOUSEWIFE

THE home managers have in their hands the most important business
of the nation. American women realize that to their duties as home
makers, mothers, and guiding influences, is added an important economic
responsibility. The manner in which the purchasing power of twenty
million home managers is used has an inestimable effect upon the
production, collection, and distribution of all products in the market.

This second edition of “The Business of Being a Housewife” is
respectfully dedicated to the thousands of wise home managers who are
determined to understand more fully their relation to the producers
of the country and to the great industries, such as that of Armour
and Company, who have made possible the providing of perfect food in
perfect condition at any distance from the farm.


ECONOMIC CHANGES

A study of the national and world situation on food production shows
that old-time low food prices may never return. Formerly much of the
food was raised by numerous individual families on Government land
at nominal cost; today practically all food is raised on expensive
land—the plains have been turned into villages and farms by the
increasing population. Many men and expensive machinery and equipment
are needed to produce our present high standard products.

It became economically unsound for so great a percentage of food
producers to spend their time in producing meats and staples, only part
of which could be consumed by themselves and their near neighbors,
the rest going to waste. The great waste of the surplus products set
the minds of men of genius to devising ways to preserve the foods of
abundant harvests for the seasons of scarcity. The result is before
us in the form of modern cold-storage plants, refrigerator cars,
volume-curing and pickling of meat products, and volume-canning of
fish, meats, fruits, and vegetables; great cereal factories, etc.

The standard of quality has been raised and the sanitary handling
of foods greatly developed. While this has increased the prices a
little, it has also increased the efficiency and earning power of the
consumer and has tended towards the better health of the nation. The
only way to equalize prices, for the high quality of foods demanded by
discriminating home managers, is through efficient commercial handling
and the conservation of every bit of material. While the efficiency of
the Armour organization is regarded as of the highest standard, the
organization is continually striving to still further increase this
efficiency.

Armour and Company act as a great service link between the farmers
and consumers. Through our agricultural department we reach out to
the farmer and advise him in producing the best meat animals and farm
products within his farm’s possibilities. We assist him to improve his
soil and to feed his animals to the best advantage.

The raw material buyers for Armour and Company are all experts in their
special lines. They search the markets to select the best products
for each branch of our service. Then various corps of specialists
analyze and prepare the foods in the most efficient, scientific, and
satisfactory way for the consumer. Through able management the most
expert service today goes into the translating of a meat animal into
wholesome U.S. Government inspected meat, either fresh, smoked, dried,
prepared, or canned.


BUY FOR REAL VALUE

Expensive experimenting with foods may be eliminated from your
accounts by the simple method of buying by known brands. Label
reading is today’s most important buying guide. A dealer soon learns
the wants of his quality buyers, and, knowing your demand for high
standard commercially prepared foods, he will be careful to select
correspondingly good quality foods when replenishing his stock.

Every careful home maker demands that the meat she buys, whether
fresh, smoked, dried, cured, or canned, bears a U. S. Government
inspected-and-passed label, and should demand canned foods marketed
under a reliable firm name.

Standards of purity and quality in the preparation of commercial foods
have gradually raised, until now there is practically every food for
every need in convenient sanitary packages at your corner market under
a quality label guarantee.

Drudgery has been literally taken out of food preparation. Madam Home
Manager’s time may now well be employed along more constructive lines
than in shelling peas and stringing beans. Hers is the responsibility
and privilege of selecting foods for her family’s menus in such
combinations that every food-need of the body is supplied in proper
proportion.


    _Be sure of real value for every expenditure_


DO YOU KNOW FOOD VALUES?

This is one of the most serious matters before us today, and the
physicians of the entire country are deploring the fact that many of
the children of the wealthy as well as of the poor are undernourished.
Do you know foods? Prepared foods release you from less important
tasks, that you may have time to learn food values. It rests with
the responsible housewife to plan her own time so as to achieve the
greatest returns in the health and efficiency of her family. Food
knowledge means a better-fed nation.

A pantry stocked with a wide variety of quality foods and a working
knowledge of individual needs and food values will make it possible
for the home manager to prepare the proper foods within her budget
limitations.


PLAN YOUR EXPENDITURES

A simple budget, or account keeping system, is a necessity in every
well-ordered, successful business. The world of today holds so many
attractions that we must carefully select those necessities and
comforts that will mean the most in real value to us, and then adhere
to that selection. The only way to know that we are following our own
plan is to have a simple accounting system. At the end of the month,
we should look over the figures and decide upon the readjustments
necessary. To insure progress and stability, our monthly accounts
should show some savings and advancement expenditures.

We offer suggestions throughout this book, arranged to help the average
housewife solve her knotty home-managing problems. We have been greatly
assisted by the women editors of national women’s publications,
prominent home economics teachers, and writers on vital home subjects.
This array of talent aims to make this book of the greatest help
possible to the American Housewife.

                                             —_Jean Prescott Adams_


ARMOUR PRODUCTS

Many thousands of housewives have come to depend upon the Armour
Oval Label as a buying guide for a wide variety of their pantry and
refrigerator staples; they know they can depend upon the uniformity and
quality of every Oval Label product.

Madam Home Manager receives the full benefit of our fifty-some years
of experience in caring for foods. She has the Armour assurance
of uniformity and quality and is guided in her buying by the
distinguishing quality Oval Label.

We prepare and distribute with great efficiency, fresh, smoked, cured,
dried, prepared, and canned meats, all Government inspected.

A full line of Armour shortenings and frying mediums, as well as our
economical oleomargarines and delicious Cloverbloom Butter, may be
secured from your dealer. Salad oil under the Oval Label, as well as
peanut butter, will continue to meet with popular favor. The evaporated
milk and identifiable or carton eggs are considered indispensable by
the average home manager.

Cheese is becoming more and more favored for its high food value, and
it is with satisfaction that many learn of the great variety of cheese
sold under the Armour guarantee of quality.

Armour’s Pork and Beans, Peanut Butter, Evaporated Milk, Mince Meat,
etc., are favorite products, and Madam Home Manager will be able to
obtain the well-established Armour brands at her market.

Armour and Company maintain a well organized department of Food
Economics as a medium of expression to the American housewife. This
department is made up of trained and experienced dietitians, teachers
of home economics, food chemists, practical home managers, writers and
lecturers.

We are equipped and prepared to give every home maker the practical,
technical and economic information she may need on any food or home
managing subject.




THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK


It is the purpose of this book to assist Madam Home Manager in her
mastery of the problems incident to the feeding of a family for health,
happiness and efficiency.

To simplify the presentation of this very important material, we
have divided the book into four sections: Section one covers the
apportionment of the income; Section two deals with the wise selection
of foods and the place of each class of food in the building of a
well-balanced menu. Section three is devoted to fundamental cookery
suggestions. Section four holds for the reader a wealth of general
information to assist in simplifying the labor of cookery.

As this is a manual of household efficiency and economy, we have aimed
to give the greatest possible number of helpful suggestions, referring
the reader to a number of splendid cook books for recipes. (_See Page
28_)

    _Keep this book handy for constant reference_




MAKING YOUR DREAMS COME TRUE


Every home maker has a cherished ideal for the various members of her
family. The rapidity with which that dream is realized depends upon how
the family income and individual energy are used. To those who have
never kept a record of expenditures, the first definite step toward
establishing a substantial financial basis and assuring progress to the
family is the keeping of an expense account. Each day, make an accurate
accounting of all expenditures. Keep this carefully for four months,
then, with that account as a basis, plan your expenditures for the next
four months and live within that plan. The third quarter, keep your
expense account again and then you will have the accurate information
regarding the financial needs of your particular family. After a
careful analysis, make up a year’s budget, cutting down non-essentials
and adding to accounts that really mean an advance step toward your
goal.

The following percentages will serve as a guide showing the
possibilities of various incomes. Each family will find it necessary
to adjust the figures according to special needs, local conditions and
family ambitions. Special education is worth economy in many lines, as
it offers future returns and is really an investment.

The food section of the Family Account Book is perhaps the most
important. Without properly prepared food in proper combination, and
quantity, we are not able to exercise our greatest earning ability, to
grasp new situations as we should, or to invest our savings wisely. By
keeping the food account according to the body building uses of the
food purchased, we daily progress in our food knowledge and become
adepts at using alternative foods.

When one really operates a budget plan to win, it is an advancement in
itself. In cases of a large independent income it is wise to have your
banker’s representative work out a budget for you. The budget outline,
on page 6, is estimated for a family of five, one young child, two
school children, mother and father. Where the family is smaller, the
food and clothing accounts will change, the amount saved going either
to savings, investments, or advancements.

FORM FOR YOUR FAMILY BUDGET

Itemized Accounting of Expenditures and Percentage Apportionment of
Income.

Estimated for Family of Five on $300 a Month. Percentages of
Expenditures for Food, Operating and Contingency vary according to
income.

The accompanying is a family budget outline that is easily adjustable
to entirely satisfactory use in your home. If the home manager, by
means of her ingenuity or by doing work herself, saves on the regular
scheduled expenditures, that money should go to her personal account.
Preparedness is a big factor in the growth of the Home Manager’s credit
column.

With this form as a guide, lay out your family budget outline, in any
ordinary notebook eight by eleven inches. Substitute your own income
and percentage figures, listing your needs under their proper heads. As
this outline is general, it may contain some suggestions better fitted
to your neighbor—just leave these items out of your budget and add any
others in their proper class.

The analysis of your needs and expenses necessary to make up your very
own budget is a great help toward keeping within your income bounds.

Attach a pencil to your account book and keep it where you will put
down the day’s expenditures regularly each evening.

Make your budget a co-operative affair, soliciting suggestions from the
family as to what investments, savings, etc., to make.

SELECTING FOODS FOR QUALITY AND VARIETY


PROTEIN FOODS

Food experts agree that 20 per cent. of the entire diet should
consist of protein. In our country, meat is the favorite protein
food. It provides a portion of the energy which is also furnished by
carbohydrates and fats, but its chief purpose is to supply material for
growth and repair of the body tissues which are constantly worn out in
the performance of their various functions.


FRESH BEEF

Much of the frontier, upon which vast numbers of cattle were formerly
raised, is now cut up into small farms and town lots. Hereafter, we
must raise the greater portion of our meat animals upon expensive
land and feed. The cost of production has increased many fold and
consequently meat is higher in price. Packers, through utilizing
by-products, keep the cost of wholesome meat within the reach of the
consumer.

U.S. GOVERNMENT MEAT INSPECTION

Every home manager should have a thorough understanding of what U. S.
Government Inspection of meat is—its significance and importance in her
selection of meats. Practically everyone who has ever purchased meat
has noticed a round purple stamp, the size of a half dollar, bearing
the words “U. S. Inspected and Passed,” in the center of the commercial
cuts displayed.

The government stamp on the meat you purchase is your absolute
guarantee that the meat you are buying is wholesome. It signifies
that the animal from which that piece of meat was cut had passed four
separate inspections, and that the meat was found to be free from all
disease and in perfect condition when it left the packing house.

Government meat inspection is one of the greatest protections to the
American table. Only concerns doing interstate business offer this
protection.

All meats have four inspections. The ante-mortem inspection is termed
“on the hoof.” The three post-mortem inspections are made upon the
glands of the neck, on the viscera and on the dressed carcass.

Only about 60 per cent of the meat consumed in the United States is
United States Government inspected. When the public shall demand that
all meats be inspected, we will have the much-needed nation-wide
inspection, which will insure wholesome meats for all. Women’s
organizations should make this movement a definite part of their
regular programs and consider it a duty to buy only U. S. Government
inspected meats.

The products of each packing house are identified by the letter and
number and the U. S. Gov’t Inspection mark on each commercial cut.


COLD STORAGE HELPS SOLVE THE NATION’S FOOD PROBLEMS

Cold storage is a great factor in the present solution of the
nation’s food problems. It is a means of holding certain foods over
from the season of plenty to the season of scarcity. Since the
first mechanical refrigeration was installed in the late eighties,
Government investigators have been continually studying various methods
of preserving food, without canning, and all insist that there is
no modern method which equals cold storage. Understanding is fast
eliminating the prejudice against use of supplies from cold storage
plants of reputable houses.

The first cold-storage house was cooled by the use of a mixture of
crushed ice and salt. The modern process is the ammonia brine method.
As the liquid ammonia enters the pipes that carry the refrigeration
through the cooler, it expands and is forced through the pipes as an
ammonia gas. An absorption method is also frequently in use. Ammonia
brine is by far the best method of cooling. It is cleanly, absolutely
odorless and, through use, has proved its efficiency.

The establishment of scientific refrigeration plants has made possible
a variety and abundance of food at any season on the American table.

Coolers are kept at an average temperature of 38° F. for foods kept a
short time. The temperature of the freezer is normally ten above zero
to ten below. Fresh meats are not allowed to stay in the coolers longer
than one to two weeks. If they must be held longer, they are sent to
the freezer. When meat is to be thawed, it is taken from the freezer
and sent to the coolers. Once taken from the freezer and defrosted,
neither meat nor any other food should ever go back. There are time
limiting cold-storage laws in twenty states. Twelve months is the limit
of time allowed in nineteen states.


BUTTER AND EGGS

Butter in cold storage is kept at a temperature of zero to five below.
Its sweetness and delicate flavor is the same when taken from storage
as when put in.

Eggs that are absolutely fresh and in perfect condition when placed in
cold storage, will keep perfectly at a temperature between 29° F. and
31° F. for six to nine months. Eggs laid in April and May are kept for
midwinter use, and the June pack is used in autumn and early winter
when the supply is scarce and prices high.


POULTRY

The box of frozen poultry your dealer displays fresh from cold storage
is most attractive and appetizing. A Nationally known name on the
box guarantees the quality. Such poultry was especially selected and
carefully fed some time before killing. It is fine-flavored and dainty.
Always buy your frozen poultry in the frozen state and thaw it out at
home. Directions for thawing are on page 13.


    _Cold storage makes possible a full variety of foods at
    all seasons_




GREAT VARIETY OF MEAT CUTS

The great importance of meat as food lies in its high protein content.
Protein is body building material. It forms one-fifth of our food
requirements. Half of the protein requirement is furnished by meat. In
lean meat the solid protein is very nearly in the pure form.

Meat is delicately constructed with small cells of tissue holding the
flavory juices. These cells are held together by a connective tissue.
In the cheaper cuts of meat, the cells or fibers holding the juices are
long and the connective tissue thick. In the structure of the expensive
steaks and loin cuts, the cells are short and the connective tissue
thin. It is this difference in structure that makes it necessary to
use entirely different methods of cooking for the tender cuts and for
the cheaper ones. The same result—a tender, flavory, nutritious cut of
meat—may be obtained with the cheaper cut as with the expensive loin
cuts, if the proper method of cooking is employed.


EQUALIZING YOUR MEAT BUYING

One so often hears the remark, “I wish someone would invent a new
animal.” The housewife is tired of ordering beef, mutton, pork or veal
day after day. Too often she orders only the roasts, steaks or chops
from these typical animals and then complains because her meat bill is
high. This idea of lack of variety in fresh meats is all because of the
unsound and uninteresting habit of buying the same cuts over and over
again.

For every loin of beef there are several other cuts besides the extra
portions, such as heart, liver, kidney, brain, etc. In these lie
possibilities for many distinctive dishes and interesting flavors.

While there are not so many cuts of pork and lamb, there are great
possibilities for variety in the preparation.

Nine out of ten home managers have believed for years, as do some
even now, that the more expensive and most tender cuts of meat must
naturally be most nutritious and that the cheaper, long fibered
cuts are to be discarded or left for the butcher to dispose of, not
realizing that their purchase of the tender cuts only, forces prices
of these cuts high enough to cover the cost of the carcass. We are
grateful that our leading dietitians of today are teaching women the
truth: that the cheaper cuts of meat are exactly as nutritious as the
tenderer cuts, if not more so, because the blood is drawn to the parts
in which the muscles are constantly used, thus continually rebuilding
the tissue.

In a dressed beef carcass of 700 pounds there are about 200 pounds
of prime meat. The loin of the hind quarter, composed of sirloin,
porterhouse, and club steaks, and the prime ribs of the fore quarter,
are the commercial cuts most tender and easily prepared, and so are
most in demand. Your butcher orders the cuts you demand. If you neglect
the cheaper cuts and extra meat portions, he will not order them, and
the expense of their production will be distributed over the cuts in
demand.

An economically sound buying campaign would be a resolution by the
housewives to use in its regular order every cut on a side of meat
before reordering a cut. One of the extra meat portions could well be
every third meat purchase.

In order to secure the most satisfactory cuts of meat, marketing
should be done in person. Before this can be done with any degree of
satisfaction, the buyer should be familiar with the various cuts of
beef, pork and mutton.

The meal is planned around the meat dish, as a rule; so it is most
important to select the main meat dish with greatest care.


HOW TO SELECT MEAT

When buying beef, see that it is bright red in color, streaked with
fat—and firm. The streaks of fat add to the food value and make a more
flavory steak or roast. Veal is pink in color, but less firm. Mutton
flesh is firm and dull red in color, the fat hard and white or slightly
yellow. Pork is dark pink in color and the fat is less firm than beef
or mutton.


SUPPLYING YOUR DEALER WITH FRESH MEAT

The modern system of refrigeration has made world-wide distribution of
fresh meat possible. Refrigerator cars, iced en route in such a manner
that the contents are kept always in a current of cold air, make it
possible to carry the products of the packing house to remote parts of
the country and deliver them in sound condition.

The housewife in turn may have such products by being discriminating in
her marketing, skillful in her cooking and careful in her serving.

By a knowledge of all the cuts of meat, the housewife can keep down her
meat expenditures. She should also have her recipe file well stocked
with tested recipes for the wide variety of popular meat dishes to be
made with the less expensive cuts.

For those who do not include meat in their diet, there is a wide
variety of non-meat protein foods to choose from. Eggs, cheese, milk,
and beans will give the necessary protein for a complete diet.

BEEF THE FAVORITE MEAT


Much of the vigor and force of Americans is attributed to the beef
which is so generously included in the American diet. It is the
favorite meat of a large percentage of people of every nation because
it is easy to secure, is delicious of flavor and, properly cooked, is
easily assimilated. The best cuts of beef for broiling are porterhouse,
sirloin, and tenderloin steaks. For roasting, the prime ribs are
preferred, while for the pot roast the rump, round, chuck, shoulder
clod and brisket result in a tender piece of meat of delicious flavor
when subject to slow, moist cooking.

POULTRY

Poultry is one of the most popular meats found upon the American
table. Dry-picked poultry is the most sanitary and desirable. It is
no simple matter to provide fresh poultry to our thickly populated
cities. But with improved breeding, scientific feeding and the modern
cold-storage houses and refrigerator cars, Armour and Company supply
a large clientele with either fresh or cold-storage poultry of the
highest quality. “Spring chickens,” so called because before the days
of storage they could be obtained only in the spring—are from three to
six months old. The older members of the chicken family are known as
“fowl.”

[Illustration: Roast Fowl]


HOW TO SELECT

A chicken’s feet are soft and smooth and the end of the breastbone is
flexible. Poultry that is to be carried over from the season of plenty
is carefully selected and specially fed and prepared. Only the choicest
corn and milk fed poultry is worthy of the skill and science displayed
in modern cold storage. Scientific methods of packing fresh poultry,
and shipment in the refrigerator cars originated by the packers,
assures the most select fresh poultry in season. The undrawn poultry is
preferred to the drawn poultry in the market.

To thaw frozen poultry, submerge it in a pan of cold water and leave in
the water until thawed—about four hours for a four-pound hen. Cook as
soon as thawed.

To “draw,” it is only necessary to make an incision below the
breastbone just large enough to insert the hand and remove the entire
viscera at once. Separate the giblets, remove the gall bladder without
breaking it, and clean the gizzard by cutting through the flesh and
removing the inside sack intact; peel the fleshy part off the sack.
Insert two fingers under the skin of the breast and draw out and
discard crop and windpipe. Wash the inside of the bird by allowing
clean cold water to run through it. Wipe inside and out. From this
point the chicken is treated according to the method to be used in
cooking. If it is to be “fried,” it is split in half lengthwise, if
very young, or in smaller pieces if it is a fowl. For a roast, the
chicken is left whole; for stewing, the fowl is entirely disjointed.

MAIN DISHES FOR MANY MEALS


LAMB

Lamb and mutton afford welcome meat dishes. Lamb is most easily
digested and very nutritious.

From a standpoint of economics, the increased use of lamb and mutton
results in greater production of wool.

In the menu, lamb and mutton should hold a permanent place because of
the number of attractive and wholesome dishes they afford. The crown
roast of lamb is a decorative and delicious dish. The leg of lamb and
shoulder roll are just of the right size to be convenient for the
average family. With a sauce of tart jelly accompanying, they make an
excellent special or company dinner dish. There are the loin chops;
“French” and “American” rib chops, delicious morsels when broiled; the
shoulder, which may be made into a mock duck that would deceive the
most observant; the neck and other cuts, which make delicious stews,
ragouts and broth. Twice a week is not too often to have lamb in the
menu.

PORK

The story of pork in the menu takes us back to the days when the
Chinese people discovered the goodness of roast pork when the house
burned and accidentally resulted in the first “burnt pig.” Every house
in the village was soon in ashes to supply every inhabitant with the
delicacy, and its popularity has steadily increased.

Like all meat, pork is classed among the protein foods and builds body
tissue. Because of its high percentage of fat, it also supplies heat
and energy to the body.

The U. S. Government Inspection stamp guarantees the wholesomeness of
the pork you buy.

The digestibility of pork depends largely upon proper cooking—it
should be thoroughly cooked in a slow oven. Smoked pork, in the form of
ham and bacon, is very easily digested, this being due to the curing
and smoking.

In planning the menu including pork, include vegetables containing
considerable water, such as cabbage or greens, and tart fruit and spicy
dessert. Such a combination will complete a meal rich in food value and
satisfying to the appetite.

HAM AND BACON

Ham and bacon are two of the most popular foods in the American market.
These tasty staple foods serve a double purpose. While they are perhaps
the most satisfactory stimulators of a dull appetite, they are such
hearty foods that in proper combination they easily satisfy the most
ravenous appetite.

Hams smoked in the stockinet covering retain their shape and keep moist
and juicy to the last slice. The covering should be left on the raw ham
and folded or tied over the cut surface so the ham will retain all the
delicate nut flavor given by our special cure and expert handling.

The ideal ham is firm, moist, juicy, tender and of medium weight, not
too fat or too lean. The stockinet covering keeps the selected ham
moist and firm.

Ham in some form is a welcome part of either breakfast, luncheon or
dinner several days every week.

[Illustration: Spiced Baked Ham]

Bacon should be fine and firm—it is selected to suit varying tastes and
may be purchased with either the fat or lean predominating or evenly
distributed. Through the smoking process certain changes take place in
meats which render them more easily digested, hence bacon is one of the
most easily digested and savory forms of fat. As sources of heat and
energy, bacon and ham rank high.

Even for a small family, it is wise to buy a whole ham. This kind
of quantity buying is economical and the many ways to serve ham add
variety to your menus. In planning the use of the whole ham, first use
the slices for broiling, baked slice of ham, creamed ham and other
dishes requiring slices or cubes of ham. Use the last half of the ham
for baking in the piece.

Bacon in the piece or cartons of bacon should be kept on hand at all
times. A breakfast of bacon and eggs is the accepted breakfast and
may be quickly and easily prepared. A few strips of bacon add just
the right flavor to the roast fowl, meat loaf, larded tenderloin, or
casserole of vegetables or cereals.

The drippings from ham and bacon should be kept in a cold place and
used for shortening in spice cakes and cookies, for flavor in sauces
for vegetables and meats, for sautéing where the smoked meat flavor is
desirable, in the dressing for vegetable salads, and in the stuffing
for fowl.

MILK THE COMPLETE FOOD


Milk is nature’s own food. It contains all the food elements necessary
for body growth, protein, mineral salts, carbohydrates, fats, vitamines
and water. It is the indispensable food for the young. It lends itself
to a great variety of uses in the correct diet of the individual.
Modern housekeeping demands that a supply of a quality brand of canned
milk be in every pantry.

As an addition to coffee or tea, evaporated milk has long been a
recognized boon. Now, however, the convenience of this as a pantry
staple for the country, town or city home cannot be overestimated. It
is ever ready for the milk or cream call necessary to the completion of
a perfect festive meal, or the easily digested milk toast or eggnog for
the convalescent as well as the everyday baking need.

According to latest scientific experiments, the growth properties known
as vitamines, so rich in milk, are in no way affected by the process of
water elimination used to produce evaporated milk.

Evaporated milk is a product of the greatest importance to all families
far removed from the source of a reliable fresh milk supply. It is just
the pure milk with a large part of the moisture removed. It contains
all the natural butter fats, mineral salts, proteins, and solids of
the fresh milk. Nothing is changed in evaporated milk excepting the
quantity of water in the fluid. For that reason, when canned milk is
used to feed to children it is best to purchase a reliable brand of
evaporated milk. Condensed milk is whole milk reduced by heating; it
differs from evaporated milk in that it has 40% to 44% sugar added.

A high quality evaporated milk contains 26.16% solids and 69.24% water.
A test of the keeping qualities of this product demonstrated that
evaporated milk would keep sweet ten days after the can was opened. On
souring it may be used the same as soured whole milk and with equally
good results.

To use evaporated milk as whole milk, it should be diluted in the
proportion of one cup of evaporated milk to two and one-quarter cups of
water. This will give a product averaging a rich whole milk.


VARIETY OF USES

Evaporated milk is most satisfactory for cream soups; for sauces
for vegetables, fish and meats. Whipped for puddings (undiluted).
Used diluted, it gives splendid results in cakes, muffins, biscuits
and other flour mixtures. As cream for coffee, cocoa and chocolate,
cereals, fruits and puddings it adds food value and flavor. As a
beverage diluted with water or for eggnog it is just as satisfactory as
ordinary milk for children. For ice creams and custards, cream candies
and fudge it adds a smoothness and creaminess.

TISSUE BUILDING FOODS


CHEESE

Cheese has an important mission in the dietary; served as an
accompaniment, it adds food value, flavor and distinction. In large
quantities it may take the place in food value of the meat dish. It
must, of course, be served in combination with vegetables or cereal
food to supply the proper bulk.

Cheese contains protein and fat. It builds tissue and creates heat and
energy. For variety it may occasionally be served as the main food for
a meal—and adds zest when used in salads and other table specialties.

In fuel value, one pound of cheese is equal to three and one-third
pounds of baked beans—or three quarts of whole milk, twenty-five
average size eggs, or of peanut butter approximately three-fourths
pounds.

Popular cheese dishes are Spaghetti and Cheese, Macaroni and Cheese,
Cauliflower and Cheese au Gratin, Potatoes au Gratin, Melted Cheese
Sandwiches, Cheese Crackers, Eggs au Gratin, Cheese Croquettes, etc.


PEANUT BUTTER

Peanut Butter is a highly concentrated, rich food, containing protein,
carbohydrates and fat, all in large proportion. For this reason it may
be used as a main dish in the menu in proper combination. Peanut loaf,
peanut soufflé, peanut omelet, and peanut salad are fitting main dishes
for the dinner or luncheon.

In order to properly balance in the diet, peanut butter must be
combined with foods of more bulk and less food value. Salad dressing
and peanut butter make excellent sandwiches. Combined with tomato pulp
and milk, peanut butter forms delicious soup. It may be used to flavor
and to shorten cookies and drop cakes. It also adds to custards or
salads. Due to its popular flavor, it also lends itself for use in the
making of delicious confections.


BEANS

Beans are in the class with meat and cheese as protein food and may
alternate with them as the main dish in the menu. They offer a variety
to the menu served as bean loaf, soufflé, croquettes, relish, salad, or
as purée.

The choicest commercially prepared pork and beans are made from
selected double hand-picked Michigan pea beans with carefully selected
government-inspected pork. They are cooked by the Appert Dry Steam
Process, thereby blending and retaining all the delicious bean flavor.

This dry steam process renders the beans more easily digestible than is
possible for home-cooked beans.


EGGS

Eggs contain all of the elements necessary to life. Next to milk,
selected eggs are the most economical source of animal protein and,
like milk, contain the growth elements popularly known as fat soluble
A. Vitamines.

The highly concentrated food value of eggs makes it necessary to
combine them with such starchy foods as bread or potatoes so that there
will be sufficient bulk food for the stomach to act upon. Eggs are an
excellent substitute for meat and are as indispensable as sugar in
cooking. It is necessary to cook eggs slowly and at a low temperature
to have them easily digested.

THE TASTY SAUSAGE

Delicately seasoned sausage, made of carefully selected
Government-inspected meats, has a very definite place as a staple food.
Sausage is all food, no waste, and most appetizing. The correctly
blended seasonings of high-grade sausage, fresh, smoked or dry, start
the gastric juices and act as an aid to digestion.


FRESH PORK SAUSAGE

Fresh pork sausage is very high in fuel value, the fat adding to the
protein, heat and energy-producing material. This makes it essentially
a cold-weather food. The drippings should always be saved to use as a
sautéing medium or shortening.


HOW TO SERVE

Fresh sausage, either links or bulk. Fry and serve with toast, pancakes
or muffins, mashed potatoes, rice or hominy, for breakfast, dinner or
luncheon. Stuff potatoes and apples with fresh pork sausage, bake and
serve as a nutritive luncheon novelty.

Tart fruit always adds to the meal of which fresh pork sausage is the
main dish.


SMOKED SAUSAGE

Bologna and Frankfurters have gained wide reputation as dependable
meats satisfactory for all informal occasions. They are made of pork,
beef, and mutton. They are carefully spiced with delicate mild spices.


SUGGESTIONS FOR SERVING

Smoked sausage may be used for any meal. The Bologna is preferable for
luncheon dishes and picnics; the Frankfurters for any hot meal.

[Illustration: Frankfurters offer many possibilities]

Left-overs of either sausage may be made into such appetizing breakfast
dishes as omelet, creamed sausage on toast or heated in the oven with
mashed potatoes.

[Illustration: More than the best breakfast]


DRY SAUSAGE

As dry sausage is a product which originated across the water, American
housewives are rapidly learning to appreciate its higher food value.
Fresh U. S. Gov’t inspected meat cuts are selected and combined with
the choicest seasonings and subjected to unique curing processes,
making this a most delicious food ready to eat. There is a wide variety
to suit every taste. Recipes from Italy, France and the other foreign
countries are followed or improved upon to make American dry sausage
the superior food it is.

Dry sausage may be made into a great variety of appetizing dishes or
served sliced, cold. It is wholesome and nutritious. An attractively
garnished platter of Dry Sausage is a favorite for a cold meal.


HOW TO SERVE

BREAKFAST: Creamed dry sausage with apple-fritters; diced and cooked in
pancakes; stuffed into potatoes before baking; or in fritters.

LUNCHEON: Dry sausage croquettes, dry sausage sandwich; cheese and dry
sausage rarebit; omelet au summer sausage.

DINNER: Dry sausage dressing for fowl or meat, dry sausage stuffed
in peppers, dry sausage with tomato sauce; potatoes stuffed with dry
sausage and cheese; dry sausage meat loaf; casserole of dry sausage and
hominy.

READY TO SERVE MEATS

As the many advantages of ready-cooked canned meats have become
more generally known, their universal use has constantly increased,
so that to-day thousands of housewives maintain on their pantry
shelves a variety of canned meats to supply all regular and emergency
requirements.

Meat was first put up in cans to prolong its keeping qualities,
especially during the hot weather season. So uniformly successful were
these experiments that the original purpose has been almost forgotten,
and canned meat now occupies an all-year-round prominent place in the
national food supply.

When canned meats are sold under a nationally known brand name, such
as Armour’s Veribest, you can be sure that the meats are carefully
selected, U. S. Government inspected, and prepared, cooked and seasoned
in sanitary, scrupulously clean kitchens by the most expert chefs.
Complete sterilization, accompanied by a vacuum process of sealing,
guarantees their perfect keeping qualities and enables the home manager
to serve this meat on her table with all the deliciousness of meat
prepared by the nation’s most expert cooks.

The cost per pound is a trifle higher than fresh meat, but it is
already cooked, there is no shrinkage, it is 100% edible, and therefore
can be served on the table at a relatively lower cost. Canned Meats
served either hot or cold can be prepared in as many appetizing ways as
fresh meat.

The housewife should always buy canned meats by brand name; for the
label, plus the U. S. Government Inspection stamp, is the safest buying
guide that can be found.

In every home where meals are served regularly it is a great
convenience to have on the pantry shelf a complete supply of canned
meats, for it takes the guesswork out of cookery, saves time and labor,
and assures the home manager of a successful meat dish for any regular
or emergency meal.

Any first-class dealer can supply you with a complete variety of high
quality canned meats.

Always read the label when buying and be sure to look for the U. S.
Government inspected and passed legend on every can of meat you buy.


MEAT LOAF

Meat loaf is made from choice selected Government Inspected meats.
Prepared commercially by chefs who daily use the same accurate
measurements of beef and pork trimmings combined with macaroni, eggs,
cheese and seasonings. The results are standard products. When whole,
the loaves average about six pounds in weight.

Meat loaves are widely popular, time and energy savers for the
housewife and may be purchased in any amount desired, from your
butcher, grocer or delicatessen.


VARIETY OF LOAF GOODS

  Special Loaf—Selected beef and pork, macaroni, eggs, cheese and
                                                seasonings.
  Meat Loaf—     “       “    “   “    bread crumbs, eggs and
                                                seasonings.
  Veal Loaf—     “      veal  “   “    cracker meal and seasonings.

In more elaborate form are jellied loaves. Such meats as tongue, tripe,
pigs’ feet, corned brisket of beef and ox lips are selected, cooked
whole, covered with gelatine and molded into loaf form. They require no
home preparation, are ready to slice and serve.


JELLIED LOAVES

    Jellied Lambs’ Tongue
    Jellied Tripe
    Jellied Pigs’ Feet
    Corned Beef and Gelatine

LUNCHEON MEATS

Luncheon meats are made of selected pork trimmings cut in somewhat
larger portions than for the loaf meats. These meats, carefully
seasoned, mixed and cooked, suggest a great variety of dishes.

As an appetizer, sandwich fillers, sliced cold on lettuce or in salad,
luncheon meats have come into great favor.

EXTRACT OF BEEF

Extract of Beef adds the distinctive touch to many meat and fish
sauces, soups and gravies. It is a valued meat extender as it adds the
meat flavor necessary to make a small amount of meat, flavor a large
amount of cereal in a loaf or croquettes. Many salads and vegetable
dishes are greatly improved by the addition of a bit of Extract of Beef
to the sauce.

FATS FOR SPREADS AND COOKING

[Illustration]

A properly balanced diet contains a regular supply of fat. The
ideal diet determined by weight, height, occupation and general
health of the individual contains just sufficient quantity of fat
and carbohydrates to give the required amount of heat and energy.
In popular terms, one-fifth of the diet should consist of fat. Much
of this may be fat of vegetables or meats, but some of it should be
butter fat or its equivalent, especially for children because of the
vitamines it contains. Scientists agree that oleo oil also contains the
growth-promoting elements.

The necessity of fat in the diet has been proven by numerous
experiments. Animals lacking certain fats do not grow and cannot
reproduce. Disastrous results have attended nations where shortage of
supplies made it impossible to include the necessary fat in the diet.

Fats supply a large part of the heat and energy required, an ounce
giving two and one-half times as much heat and energy as an ounce of
carbohydrates. Butter, oleomargarine, nut margarines, pure leaf lard,
bacon, salt pork, the fats of beef, mutton, pork and fowl, vegetable
fats and oils and peanut butter are our principal sources of fat. A
certain percentage is found in all nuts, cereals and vegetables. For
the average healthy person fats are not difficult to digest if not
taken in too large quantities and if the fat is properly used in the
food.


SPREADS

Butter, oleomargarine, nut margarine and peanut butter are the
spreads in general use. In a well balanced diet these may be used
interchangeably. The food value is principally in the heat and energy
furnished, which is practically equal in all the spreads. Butter and
highest grade oleomargarine contain certain growth elements not found
in the nut butter, but milk or the average well varied diet corrects
this.

Butter is one of the best sources of fat for the daily diet. High grade
creamery butter, such as Cloverbloom, is made in the heart of the rich
dairy districts, from sweet pasteurized cream.

Oleomargarine has a well recognized place among spreads, due to
a growing understanding among intelligent housewives as to its
composition and the ideal conditions under which it is made. It is made
by churning pure, sweet animal oils and vegetable oils in pasteurized
milk and salting to taste. Since the housewife knows that materials
used in oleomargarine are used daily in one form or another in her home
and that it is given Government Inspection, oleomargarine has become a
most generally used spread.

The vegetable or nut margarines are made from pure cocoanut and peanut
oils churned in pasteurized milk. They are daily growing in public
favor. The low moisture content of nut margarine and the care in
preparation make it a rich and tasty spread. Nut-ola is the popular
Armour nut margarine.

Peanut butter, although used as a spread, has become universally known
as one of our most excellent protein sources to replace meat. Easily
digested, it is not only popular with adults, but a good food for
children.

    _There is an Armour Oval Label Product for every need
    of fat in the diet or in cookery_


THE PROPER FAT FOR EVERY COOKERY USE

For shortening purposes, fats are used to improve the texture of the
product. The fat in the mixture protects the starch grains from the
moisture until the proper time in baking, allowing the leavening
agent to act and the starch grains to swell, resulting in a light
even-textured product.

[Illustration: Delicious, Nutritious Doughnuts]

It is possible to use a great variety of fats for cooking. Animal fats
have been popular shortenings. Recent fat shortage has acquainted us
with the value of vegetable fats as shortening and in spreads. Armour’s
vegetable fat is Vegetole. It contains the same fuel value and has
the same shortening value as lard. Pure Leaf Lard or vegetable fats
are the ideal shortenings. Salad Oil, highly refined vegetable fat,
Oleomargarine, Nut-ola, butter, and drippings from bacon, ham, beef and
pork are used with entire satisfaction for shortening purposes.

The fats best suited to deep frying and sautéing are those which have a
very high burning point. For general “all purpose” satisfaction, pure
leaf lard ranks first. There is an Armour product especially suited to
every cookery need.


FATS

Bacon drippings may be substituted for lard in frying, baking, or in
gravies, providing the drippings are clarified and not too strong. A
great many people prefer the flavor of bacon drippings to any other
shortening.

Beef suet drippings, for reheating meats or for frying or shortening
purposes, take the place of lard and are much more economical.

Pork fat, left from roast, chops or ham, can be used in the same manner.

Mutton drippings need no longer be set aside, since the housewife has
learned how to sweeten them.

Smoky kitchens indicate the improper use of fat in cooking. Too high
a temperature causes a chemical change to take place which results in
smoke and disagreeable odor, and also renders the fat less digestible.

Put cold fat into a cold pan before placing it over the heat. Bringing
into contact with the hot pan frequently results in burning the fat.

For deep frying and sautéing, care should be taken not to heat the fat
to too high a temperature, as burning decomposes the fat and renders it
less digestible. In deep fat frying, place the food to be fried in the
hot fat a small amount at a time. The addition of the cold food reduces
the temperature of the fat.

Do not pile fried articles. Drain on unglazed paper.

Strain fat after using, save, and use again.


FOODS SOAK FAT

When fat is not hot enough, when mixture is too rich, when mixture
is too moist, and when too much soda or baking powder has been used,
deep-fried foods will take up too much fat and be greasy.


TEST FOR TEMPERATURE

A piece of soft bread will brown in 40 seconds in deep fat that is just
hot enough for cooked articles, or in 60 seconds in fat at the right
temperature for uncooked foods.

Fat is too hot if it smokes.


TO CLARIFY FAT

To clarify the frying medium for second or third use, melt, add raw
potato cut in quarter inch slices, and allow to heat gradually; when
it ceases to bubble and the potatoes are well browned, strain through
double cheesecloth, placed over the wire strainer into a pan.


SALAD OIL USED IN COOKING

Vegetable salad oil meets all the requirements for a rich, delicately
flavored oil for salad dressing. Highly refined cottonseed oil and
cocoanut oil are American products, made from highly refined vegetable
oil. Both have proved entirely satisfactory and economical as salad
oil. Highly refined cottonseed oil for frying has a high smoking point,
and, properly used, gives off no unpleasant odor.

FRUITS TO COMPLETE THE MEAL

The dietetic value of fruits lies in the fruit sugar, mineral salts,
and organic acids which they contain. Fruits are body regulators.

Fruit sugar or carbohydrates are the chief sources of fuel value in
fruit. Most fruits also contain the substance which is necessary for
jelly making. A fruit which does not contain pectin, such as pears and
pineapple, must be combined with some fruit containing pectin. Apples,
grapes, and currants contain great quantities of pectin.

Fresh fruit eaten the first thing in the morning acts as a cleanser.
Care must be taken in the selection of fruit, it should be ripe, but
not overripe. If overripe, it is liable to cause fermentation in the
alimentary tract.

Science has perfected the drying process to such a degree that dried
fruit has become a great convenience when the fresh product is not
obtainable.

Because it is impossible to wholly consume all fruits at the harvesting
time, great quantities are canned for later consumption. To retain the
highest natural flavor and full fruit sugar value, it is necessary to
can fruits and vegetables just as they ripen and immediately after
picking. Commercial canning of fruits has reached such a high degree
of excellence that the average home manager prefers to buy a reliable
brand she knows to be uniform, rather than run the risk of having
fruits spoil that she uses her own time and material to “put up.”

The wide variety of fruits on the market under reliable brand names
makes it possible to serve practically any fruit at any season. Even
the special types of fruits may be purchased canned, as Royal Anne
Cherries, Muscat Grapes, Bartlett Pears, Egg Plums, etc.


The Fruits to Serve with Various Meats

    Apricots         Roast Lamb, Baked Ham
    Pineapple        Boiled Ham, Cheese
    Apples           Roast Pork
    Pears (spiced)   Cold Beef, Cheese
    Peaches (spiced) Veal, Cheese

All fruits combine in fruit salads, cocktails, ices.


VEGETABLES

Vegetables contain a large amount of water, cellulose, and mineral
matter. They are included under the classification of carbohydrates,
or mineral salts according to the predominance of starch or mineral
matter. Leafy vegetables are rich in vitamines.

The mineral salts afford bone building material, while the large amount
of cellulose which they contain furnishes bulk in the diet.

Canned vegetables are preserved by sterilization. Salt is used to bring
out the flavor, acts as a preservative, and increases the mineral
content.

Dried vegetables are being used in soups and ragouts. The dried
vegetables have not yet reached as extensive use as have the dried
fruits.

Commercially canned vegetables add year round variety to practically
every American table. The selection of a reliable brand simplifies the
marketing.


The Vegetables to Serve with Various Meats

Tomatoes—Broiled Steak, Lamb Chops. Asparagus—Planked Steak, Roast
Beef, Lamb Chops, Veal Chops. Spinach—Ham, Tongue, all meats, eggs,
fish. Peas—Lamb Chops, Chicken, Meat croquettes. String Beans—Ham,
Boiled Lamb, Chicken. Okra—Chicken, Tuna, Ham. Celery—Cheese Dishes.

    All vegetables combine in vegetable casseroles and
    salads.


MINCE MEAT

Mince Meat nearly conforms to the requisites of a perfect food. It
contains protein from the meat content, carbohydrates, both sugar and
starch in the form of fruits, and moisture. Spices and flavoring make
it complete. Its fuel value is considerable. It should not merely be
used as a holiday food, but as an all year round product.

Mince meat contains only the best and most wholesome ingredients. On
the market are two varieties, the condensed and moist. Moist mince meat
requires more attention because of its aptness to ferment. In making
it, green apples and fresh cider are used. As cider makes vinegar and
raisins and currants make wine, fermentation is possible. This does not
mean that the mince meat is no longer good. The alcohol formed acts as
a preservative.

Concentrated mince meat contains dried apples and boiled cider. In this
respect only does it differ from moist mince meat. By the addition of
water, the condensed becomes equal to moist. Condensing is done merely
to aid in packing and delivery.


VARIETY OF USES

Pie Patties, Brown Bread and Mince Meat Sandwich, Pudding, Tomato
stuffed with Mince Meat, Mince Meat Salad, Mince Meat Relish, Mince
Meat Cookies.


    _Armour’s Veribest Mince Meat is made of most carefully
    selected materials expertly combined_

THE PANTRY STOCK

Perhaps one of the greatest simple helps toward a well-ordered home is
a well-stocked pantry. With this to rely upon, one is always ready for
any demand that can interfere with the regular plans of the household.

Besides a carefully selected assortment of quality foods already
prepared, a number of menus and the recipes to accompany them should
be easily accessible, so that in case the home-manager herself is away
from home or is ill, almost any member of the family can keep the meals
going satisfactorily.

The pantry shelf should contain CANNED soups, fish, meats, milk,
vegetables, fruits; jams, jellies, condiments, a few packages of
cookies and crackers. A few cans of evaporated milk come in handy, even
on the farm, now and then, and will keep until needed.

Let the Armour Housewives’ Choosing List be your guide in stocking this
shelf. When a package is used, replace it at once so that the shelf
will be ready for all staple and emergency calls, sure to come when
least expected. During the warm months, many of the foods illustrated
on pages 24-25 will be kept in the refrigerator.

HOW TO PREPARE FOODS


Cookery, to meet the present day standards, is necessarily an art and a
science. (_See page 46 for measures and abbreviations._)

Skill in blending flavors, and arranging dishes to please the eye
as well as the palate, is an art of which every home manager may be
proud. Still more important, however, is the scientific preparation
of nutritious and economical dishes to supply the body needs of every
member of the family.

In these pages devoted to cookery we have covered important cookery
points which influence the palatability, digestibility, and combination
of materials for best results. Our aim is to present to the American
home manager a valuable cooking manual, not a recipe book. Below are
listed many splendid books of recipes in your public library:

SOUPS

Prepare soup stock in a kettle which will retain heat. Fit with a tight
cover, for the vapors must be held in to add to the flavor of the
stock. Shank and neck of beef, pork or lamb, left-over morsels of meat,
bones from steaks, roasts, chops and the carcasses of poultry, are good
materials from which to make meat stock.

Crack and saw bones to uniform size, put into kettle and add cold water
in the proportion of three cups of cold water to one pound of bones.

Let stand for one-half hour or until water is colored by juices, heat
to boiling point. Skim off fat, reduce heat and let simmer or bubble
slowly for four hours. The stock must be kept at low temperature in
cooking so that the albumen or jelly of the meat will not coagulate,
but be retained in the stock, giving it full flavor.

Cook until the meat is shredded and colorless. When nearly done, add
vegetables and seasoning. Strain, set stock aside to cool—discard
bones, reserving vegetables and meat portions, which are still rich in
food value, for further use in pressed loaves. A bit of Extract of Beef
will add the desired meat flavor.

Stock is used as the foundation for all meat and vegetable soups. Cream
soups have white sauce as a foundation with the vegetable purée added.

MEAT COOKERY


(_See pages 7, 8 and 9 for Meat Charts_)

To be sure of success in meat cookery, know first the structure of the
cut of meat you are to prepare, then use a standard tested method for
making that cut tender, flavory and juicy.

Always have a good fire before placing meat over the heat, for all meat
cookery requires the greatest heat first to seal the appetizing juices
in. Your skill will be shown in your first ten minutes of handling.

The short fibered cuts comprising the loin cuts, porterhouse, and
club steaks may be given the entire short cooking over a hot fire.
Practically all the other cuts on the carcass require long moist
cooking after the searing process.

All boiling pieces should be put into boiling water first and after ten
minutes’ brisk boiling, the heat should be reduced so that the meat
simmers until the connective tissue softens and the meat is tender and
just right for carving. Too long brisk boiling makes the meat stringy.
Roasts should be cooked on the same principle. Put into the hot oven
for fifteen minutes, then reduce the heat and cook the cut slowly,
basting frequently. Steaks and chops that are to be pan broiled, should
be put on a hot pan and quickly turned so as to sear and brown evenly,
then allowed to cook through, over the hot fire. As salt draws the
juices out of meats it should not be added until after the first ten or
fifteen minutes of cooking, when the meat is thoroughly seared.


METHODS


BROILING

This process of cooking subjects the meat, fish or poultry to the
direct rays of the fire, quickly searing and browning the meat; this is
the approved method of cooking tender steaks and chops, fish and spring
chicken. An intense, even heat is necessary.


PAN BROILING

A very hot frying pan is used without addition of any fat; chops and
steaks are cooked in this way.


ROASTING AND BAKING

Roasting is oven cooking in an uncovered pan. Baking differs only in
the fact that the pan is covered, thus making the cooking self basting.
Prime ribs, loin or leg, and fowl, are roasted; rump, short ribs and
shoulder are frequently baked.


POT ROASTING

Wipe the meat, dredge with flour and brown the entire surface in a
little fat, place the meat on a rack in a deep kettle and cover with
boiling water. Cook with vegetables and seasoning, adding vegetables at
intervals to allow for the perfect cooking of each class of vegetables
by the time the meat is done. Place cover on kettle and simmer slowly
about four hours. Serve with the thickened liquor.


BOILING

Cooking in liquid at 212° F. is boiling. Meat should never be boiled
rapidly, as the fibers become tough and the tissues dissolved. To have
boiled meats tasty and juicy, plunge the meat into boiling water and
cook for ten minutes, then lower the heat and cook slowly until tender.
An excellent way to cook shank, clod, shoulder plate, brisket or neck.
A fireless cooker is practical for this type of cookery. A pressure
cooker makes it possible to cook a tough fowl or cut of meat in a very
short time.


BRAISING

Cooking in a closely covered pan in the oven is termed braising; a
small amount of water is used. The meat is usually sautéed first, to
prevent escape of much juice. Vegetables are often cooked with the
meat. The temperature should be kept low. It is an excellent way for
cooking spareribs, brisket, rump, shoulder or chuck roast. Besides
stewing or boiling, it is an excellent way to prepare the tough cuts.


SAUTÉING

Pan frying in just enough fat to brown the foods nicely and keep them
from sticking to the pan is called sautéing. Fish, steaks, chops and
potatoes are cooked by this method.


STEWING

Meat for a stew, such as neck, clod, shank, brisket or chuck, can be
cut in small pieces, browned to hold in juices before cooking in the
boiling water; or, omitting that process, put directly in a small
amount of hot water and cooked at a low temperature for a long time.
All nutriment is retained in the meat.


DEEP FRYING

For this method of cooking, an iron kettle is best. Half fill the
kettle with fat and place over fire; melt and, when a slight blue vapor
arises, test with a small cube of bread. If bread browns in one minute,
the temperature is right for uncooked mixtures (doughnuts). If it
browns in forty seconds, it is right for cooked materials (croquettes).
The temperature of the fat should average 350-400 degrees F. Keep the
temperature even; if too cool, the food will soak fat; if too hot,
both fat and material to be cooked will burn. Foods cooked in deep fat
should be drained on brown paper.

A FEW MEAT RECIPES


ROAST CHUCK

Serves 5. Preparation 3 hours.

    4 lbs. chuck (2 first ribs of chuck, cut across)
    ¼ tsp. pepper
    ⅛ c. thinly sliced onion
    2 tbsp. flour
    ⅛ tsp. allspice
    2 bay leaves
    1 tsp. salt

Dredge the roast with flour. Rub skillet with suet and, when pan is
hot, quickly sear roast on all sides. Add seasonings, except salt.
Roast in hot oven for fifteen minutes, sprinkle with salt, lower heat
and cook slowly until tender. Baste every twenty minutes, adding a
little boiling water if necessary.

[Illustration: Prime Ribs of Beef and Browned Potatoes]


POT ROAST OF BEEF WITH SPAGHETTI

Serves 6. Preparation 4 hours.

    4 to 5 lbs. rump of beef
    1 lb. spaghetti
    2 qts. canned tomatoes
    ¼ lb. beef suet
    1 large onion
    1 large green pepper
    Grated American cheese
    2 slices of bacon
    3 bay leaves
    6 cloves
    2 cloves of garlic
    1 c. hot water
    salt and pepper

Cut the suet and bacon fine and fry. Add the onion, garlic and green
pepper chopped quite fine and fry. When beginning to brown, add the
meat, turning it so that it will be well browned on all sides. Then
add the hot water, tomatoes and the seasoning. Simmer gently for three
hours, add 2 tsp. salt and a quarter tsp. pepper at the end of an
hour and a half. Half an hour before the meat is finished, boil the
spaghetti till tender, drain it and put it into the sauce surrounding
the meat. Let cook 10 minutes. For serving, put the meat on a platter
and the sauce in a dish, grating American cheese thickly over the top.

dressing, well seasoned. Roll up and fasten with skewers or tie with a
cord. Place in a casserole, add one-fourth cup boiling water and let
bake slowly until tender. Slice and serve with the gravy.


ROAST SHOULDER OF MUTTON

Serves 5. Preparation 3 hours.

    Five-pound shoulder roast
    Salt, garlic, pepper and flour

Wipe meat. Sear quickly to seal in juices. Sprinkle with salt and
pepper. Cut garlic in two pieces and place on meat. Dredge both meat
and bottom of pan with flour. Place roast on rack in roasting pan,
and add hot water. Place in hot oven and baste every fifteen minutes.
Lower gas after the first twenty minutes’ cooking, and cook slowly
until tender. Keep meat covered and about three-fourths pint of water
in the pan, as the steaming will help make the meat tender. Cook at low
temperature.


BAKED HAM

Serves 20. Preparation 6-7 hours. (12 pounds.)

Set ham on a rack in a baking pan and bake one-half hour in a hot oven,
turning after the first fifteen minutes. Lower heat. Pour a cupful of
cider over ham and let bake five hours, basting often with the liquid
in the pan. Remove from the oven and skin. Insert cloves in the fat
of the ham, from which the skin has been taken; press these into the
ham in a symmetrical manner. Mix half a cupful of brown sugar with
half a teaspoon of pepper and half a cupful of fine cracker crumbs and
sprinkle over the portion containing the cloves; return the ham to the
oven for one hour.

MEAT SAUCES AND GRAVY

Use the meat juices left from cooked meat or fowl, removing any excess
fat. Extract of beef may be substituted for meat juices in gravy.

After removing meat and excess fat from the roasting pan or skillet,
heat meat juices to boiling and thicken carefully. To avoid lumpy
gravy, the best way is to mix the flour with a small amount of water,
stirring until smooth, then gradually adding more cold water until
the thickening is of the right consistency. Add gradually to the hot
liquid, stirring constantly.

Allow mixture to cook ten minutes. Gravy should be cooked thoroughly to
avoid any raw or starchy taste, too common to American gravies.

Season carefully, according to the meats gravy is to be served with. It
is wise to taste before serving.

The distinctive touch French chefs are noted for in their meat and
fish dishes is often due to the sauce accompanying them. Any careful
American cook can acquire the same reputation for skill by following
the suggestions to cook thoroughly and season distinctively.


FOUNDATION RECIPE FOR CREAM SAUCES FOR MEATS, FISH AND VEGETABLES

HOW TO COOK POULTRY

(_See pages 13 and 40_)


SELECTION OF YOUNG FOWL

The flesh of young fowl is smooth. The claws and feet are usually light
yellow in color and are very supple. A breastbone which bends easily
indicates young fowl. Fowl should be plump, but not over plump. If fowl
is exceptionally fat at the crop, it indicates large inner organs. They
weigh heavily, and therefore are poor purchases.


PREPARATION FOR COOKERY

Care should be taken that the fowl is drawn and thoroughly cleansed.
This is often attended to by the local butcher, but special care and
attention is also needed in the home.

The pin feathers must all be removed and the fowl singed. All blood
clots, portions of lungs, etc., should be removed. Hold fowl under
faucet, and let water from faucet rush through it to remove any
clinging portions.


TERMS USED IN SELECTING FOWL

  Chicken—Term applied to fowls under ten months.
  Broilers—Young spring chickens about six months old.
  Fowl—Term including chicken, turkey, goose and duck.
  Pullet—Young hen. Term including fowl up to the age of one year.
  Capon—Specially fattened male chicken.


METHODS OF COOKING


ROASTING

Chicken and turkey being dry meat, require frequent bastings. The
grease which accumulates in the roasting of geese must be poured off
from time to time. This should be clarified and carefully saved for
use in pastries and as spreads. Strips of salt pork or bacon if placed
across turkey or chicken baste the fowl as well as flavor it.


STEWING

Older fowl is best when stewed. The fowl should be put into boiling
water, seasoning added, and gently cooked at the simmering point for
several hours before the vegetables are added. Cook until the meat is
very tender. Add dumplings the last twenty minutes.


BROILING

Fowl that is to be broiled should be brushed well with oil and allowed
to stand in cool place some time before broiling. Sprinkling with
lemon juice also tends to make it tender as well as flavors the fowl.
Strips of bacon laid across the top baste the fowl. Turn frequently to
insure thorough cooking.


FRYING

Select young fowl for frying. Long, slow cooking is needed to
thoroughly cook the fowl. The portions are dipped in egg and crumbs to
protect them from the high heat of the pan and so keep them tender. Use
a shallow griddle and add bacon fat as necessary.


DRESSING A FOWL

In order that the legs, wings, and neck of fowl will not dry out, it is
well to truss the fowl for roasting.

Fold back the wings so that they form a “V” on the back. Fold the neck
back so that it fits beneath the wings. Fasten with twine. Bend back
legs and fasten them close to the rump. Also fasten joints close to
the body. If dressing is to be used, stuff in body and then sew up the
openings. A trussing or darning needle threaded with twine makes the
matter of trussing quite simple.


FROZEN FOWL

If fowl is purchased frozen, thaw in pan of cold water or place in
refrigerator for six hours and then dress in the usual manner. Frozen
fowl handled by a nationally recognized food organization has been
carefully selected and possesses a delicate flavor.


PRESSURE COOKERY OF FOWL

Fowl may be fried or stewed in the pressure cooker. The foods are
made ready as in the ordinary method and are placed in the bottom of
the cooker. Vegetables or cereals may be placed on the rack above and
cooked at the same time. The lid is then adjusted and the pressure
raised to about 18 pounds and then kept there for thirty minutes. Fowl
that is old is quickly cooked tender in a pressure cooker.


WAYS OF SERVING LEFT-OVER FOWL

Fricassee, creamed chicken, chicken à la king, croquettes, soufflé of
fowl, timbales, en casserole, salad, pilaff, patties, cold jellied loaf
with vegetables, club sandwiches, hot chicken sandwiches, fritters,
dumplings, pot pie, cottagers’ pie, pan roast, boned stuffed chicken,
soup, country fried, pressed chicken, forcemeat, blanketed, curry,
cutlets, gumbo, scalloped, stew.

SALADS


Salads are combinations of meat, fish, eggs, vegetables, or fruits and
nuts with a dressing.

Mayonnaise should not be added to salad until just before serving, as
it may liquefy. It is most satisfactory to mix each ingredient in a
fruit or vegetable salad with the dressing separately and combine at
the last moment.

Green vegetables, such as lettuce, should not have dressing added until
just before serving.

The flavor of meat and fish salads is improved by marinating in French
dressing before combining with other materials.


CARE OF MATERIALS


LETTUCE AND OTHER SALAD GREENS

Wash and pick over carefully as soon as brought from garden or market.
Wrap in a wet tea towel or in salad bag and place on the ice or in cold
place to keep fresh.

To keep parsley or other garnishes fresh, place in a fruit jar,
sprinkle with cold water and cover tightly. The greens will remain
fresh as long as there is moisture in the jar.

SOME HEARTY MEAT SUBSTITUTES


EGGS

Although hens’ eggs are more commonly in use, the eggs of ducks, geese,
guinea fowl and turkeys are all used as food.


USES

The various uses of eggs in cooking may be listed as follows:

    1 As a substitute for meat
    2 To clear soup and coffee
    3 To thicken sauces, etc.
    4 To make certain foods light, omelet, soufflés
    5 As a garnish
    6 To improve flavor
    7 To color certain foods
    8 To glaze breads, rolls, etc.
    9 As a leavening agent in baking


PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY

In cooking eggs, heat produces a change in both color and in firmness,
the firmness, or hardness, depending on the temperature and length of
time cooked. The change which takes place in the egg albumen is called
coagulation. A high temperature for any continued length of time will
produce a leathery consistency, which necessitates a longer time for
digestion.

Soft-cooked eggs digest more quickly and more satisfactorily than do
eggs prepared any other way.

The margin is slight, however, and the stomach takes care of all kinds
of cooked eggs.


WAYS OF COOKING AND TIME REQUIRED TO DIGEST

                   Hours to Digest

    1 Boiled { Soft          3
             { Hard          3½
    2 Poached                2½
    3 Scrambled              3½
    4 Fried                  3½
    5 Baked or Shirred       2¼
    6 Raw                    1¼


HOW TO PRESERVE

As there is a harvest time for eggs, it is necessary to insure eggs for
year around use by preserving a supply for winter release.

Preserve only fresh clean eggs in the spring and early summer when they
are cheap and plentiful. They may be preserved in any of the following
ways:

    1 Commercial cold storage is the most satisfactory method of
          preserving eggs.
    2 Pack in sawdust, salt, bran or sand, with small end down.
    3 Cover with salt brine, limewater or water glass.
    4 Coat with lard, oil or paraffin.


CHEESE


PRINCIPLES OF COOKERY

Cheese is sufficiently cooked when melted. Protein is toughened by a
high temperature, therefore a low temperature process should always be
used in preparing cooked cheese dishes.

Cheese should be kept dry and covered, but never wholly exclude the
air. If spread with melted paraffin, it will keep moist. Soft cheese
should be kept in the ice box. The receptacle for cheese should be
thoroughly sterilized before new cheese is placed in it.

Cheese gives character to many nourishing but indistinct-flavored foods.

CHEESE SOUFFLÉ

Serves 4. Preparation 20 minutes. Medium in cost.

    2 tbsp. butter or oleomargarine
    3 tbsp. flour
    ½ c. scalded milk
    Speck cayenne
    ½ tsp. salt
    ¼ c. grated American cheese
    3 eggs

Melt the oleomargarine, add the flour and when well mixed add gradually
the scalded milk. Then add salt, cayenne and cheese. Remove from the
fire and add the yolks of eggs, beaten until lemon colored. Cool the
mixture and fold into the whites, beaten until stiff. Pour into a
buttered baking dish and cook twenty minutes in a slow oven. Serve at
once. Cheese soufflé is suitable as the main dish for luncheon, dinner
or supper.


CHEESE SAUCE

Serves 5. Preparation 20 minutes.

    2 c. medium white sauce
    1 c. grated cheese

Make a medium white sauce. To each cup of sauce add half a cup of
grated cheese and cook in double boiler until melted.

Use as a sauce over macaroni, spaghetti, rice, hominy, escalloped
vegetable dishes, over toast as mock rarebit, or as a foundation for
cream of cheese soup.

VEGETABLE COOKERY


Fresh vegetables should be whole and sound when purchased. Roots and
tubers require special care as to cleanliness. Perishable vegetables
should be used as soon as purchased. If kept for any length of time,
they should be stored in a cool, dry place. From time to time, they
should be looked over and those which show signs of decay, removed.


PREPARATION FOR COOKING

The first step is cleansing. Wash thoroughly in cold water and then
pick over or scrub with a vegetable brush to thoroughly remove any
small portions of dirt that may be embedded in the outer covering
or hidden among the leaves. Remove all leaves, tops, etc. The ideal
way, from a food value standpoint, is to cook potatoes with the skins
on, for, if pared, the valuable mineral salts escape into the water.
Vegetables that are pared before cooking should be pared very thin.
Between the skin and outer layers of the vegetable lies a layer
containing much nutritive material, and, unless the parings are thin,
this material is lost. Water in which pared vegetables are cooked
should be saved and used as soup stock.


METHODS OF COOKING


BOILING

Vegetables should be cooked in boiling water. Strong smelling
vegetables, such as cabbage, onions, etc., will not give off strong
odors if cooked in plenty of water and uncovered. Other vegetables
should be cooked in just enough water to cover and the kettle should
be covered. Salt, however, toughens the fiber and, for this reason,
is only used in the cooking of young, tender shoots. For the older
vegetables the salt may be added just before serving.


STEAMING

Steaming is a very satisfactory method of cooking vegetables. The
vegetables are placed on racks in the steamer and cooked until tender.
None of the juices are lost, and the fiber is not toughened, and the
appearance and shape of the vegetables are preserved.


BAKING

Vegetables may be washed, and baked in a moderate oven until the skin
bursts. This method of cooking is satisfactory in that no nutriment is
lost. The vegetables classed as roots, such as turnips, parsnips, etc.,
may be baked, but are less suited to this method of cooking.

GARNISHES

Garnishes of vegetables are often used to give a colorful touch to
meat dishes. A little sprig of parsley is often sufficient decoration.
Clever garnishes are made by means of vegetable cutters. These are
attractive additions when used as a border around a meat dish.

Lettuce is used extensively as a garnish. It is used most commonly as a
garnish for cold meats.

        ½ c. evaporated milk
    Yolks of 2 eggs
    Grated American cheese
    Buttered cracker crumbs

Wash and tie the asparagus in a bunch and cook in boiling salted water
until tender. Drain and save the liquor for soup. Make a sauce of the
butter, flour, seasoning, stock and evaporated milk; add the yolks and
two tablespoonfuls of cheese. Stir the sauce until the cheese melts
but do not boil. Put the asparagus in a buttered baking dish and cover
with sauce. Cover with cracker crumbs and put in an oven and bake until
brown.

Cake is judged by its delicate flavor, fine grain or texture, evenly
baked crust, and appearance. Special pastry flour assures a more
delicate texture than bread flour in cake making.

PROPORTION AND USE OF MATERIALS

Salt is used to bring out flavor. Quantity used should be according to
amount of butter present. When nuts are used, the amount of salt should
be increased slightly to bring out flavor. When chocolate or cocoa is
used, decrease the amount of fat, as there is a certain amount of fat
in the cocoa and chocolate.

    _Use Armour’s Veribest Oleomargarine for cake making_




PASTRIES


PLAIN PASTRY

In plain pastry the shortening is mixed into the flour by chopping or
with tips of fingers. All ingredients and utensils should be cold.
When the lard is thoroughly chilled a large amount of ice-water can be
incorporated, which, when converted into steam, acts as a leavening
agent and makes the pastry light and fluffy.


PUFF PASTE

In puff paste the shortening is worked into a paste of flour and water
by folding and rolling. Equal parts by weight of flour and shortening
are used.


MATERIALS

Pure leaf lard is the ideal shortening for pastry making. It makes
a light colored, soft, tender crust. Pure leaf lard is made only of
leaf fat rendered in open kettles by a special process which makes the
resulting product extremely rich and delicate.

Vegetole may be successfully used, following the same methods as with
lard. Vegetole is an absolutely pure vegetable fat, processed to proper
cooking consistency without anything being added. It may be secured in
a sanitary pail in convenient size for home use.

Butter and oleomargarine are especially desirable for puff paste. A
fine pastry or cake flour will absorb moisture least and is therefore
one of the first requisites to pastry making. A small quantity of
baking powder insures lightness to pie paste, but is not an essential
to the product of an expert.


RULES

Everything must be cold, handled lightly and quickly and baked in a
hot oven, to assure delicate pastry. To prevent escape of juice, mix
cornstarch or flour with sugar and sprinkle lightly over the fruit
before covering with the top crust. Press the edges of the upper and
lower crusts tightly together. A cone of paper or piece of macaroni may
be put into the slit of the crust to allow the escape of steam.


FRENCH PASTRY

French pastries are nationally popular and are very attractive for tea
or fancy dessert service. The maker has wide scope for the display of
individuality in devising and decorating pastries. Slices of jelly
roll, loaf or sponge cake may be spread with mocha frosting to form
individual cakes. Fruit-filled tarts, topped with a bit of meringue,
are always popular. The real French pastry is made of puff paste, very
tender and flaky, and filled with fruit.


CAKE MAKING (Continued from page 36)


LEAVENING AGENTS

Baking powder, soda and eggs are used as leavening agents; this is to
make the cake light. If the number of eggs is increased in the cake
recipe, decrease the amount of baking powder. One egg is equivalent to
one teaspoon baking powder in leavening. Egg and milk together should
not exceed 1½ cups liquid with three cups flour.


SHORTENING

A large amount of fat makes a cake close-grained; a small amount
makes it porous, but it dries out easily. With too much fat, the cake
crumbles and it maybe heavy. If melted fat is used in a cake, add it
cool. If added hot, the cake will be tough, coarse in grain and less
light.


LIQUID

If water is substituted for milk, use seven-eighths cup of water
where one cup of milk is called for. If Veribest Evaporated Milk is
substituted for whole milk, use one-third cup of evaporated milk and
two-thirds cup of water. If cream is substituted for milk, lessen the
shortening and use more cream than the milk called for.


USE OF SOUR OR SWEET MILK

Soda and acid both act on gluten and tend to make it tender, so cakes
made with sour milk or buttermilk will be more tender than those made
with water or sweet milk. One scant teaspoonful of soda is necessary
to neutralize a cup of buttermilk or milk of the same sourness as
buttermilk. An excess of soda gives the product an unpleasant flavor
and, if present in too large a quantity, is injurious as well.

Sour evaporated milk is very useful in cookery. Dilute it as when sweet
and add the necessary amount of soda to the product in which it is to
be used.

Muffins, griddle cakes and biscuits are better made with sour milk than
with sweet milk. Every bit of sour evaporated milk may be used in this
way.

Evaporated milk does not sour quickly because of the thorough
sterilization in heating to the temperature necessary for evaporation.

A quality grade of evaporated milk will keep after being open some four
days before souring in warm weather and over a week in cold weather.

Foods made with sour milk are characterized by a particular softness of
texture.


    _Use Armour’s “Simon Pure” Leaf Lard or Vegetole for
    particular pastry making_




CEREALS AND FRUITS


Cereals are economical, contain unusually good proportions of necessary
food ingredients with small proportion of refuse, are readily prepared
for the table, palatable, digestible, compact, and easily preserved
without deterioration.

Rolled oats is perhaps the best-known of the cereals and lends itself
to the greatest variety of dishes, aside from its popular use as a
breakfast food.

Corn flakes are manufactured of the best pure white corn, thoroughly
toasted and ready to serve. Wheat flakes are the whole wheat berry,
flaked and toasted.

Macaroni, spaghetti, and egg noodles are made from Durum wheat
semolina, ground fine. Eggs are added to the cereal for noodles.

Hominy grits and whole hominy are favorite American breakfast cereals
and combine well with other foods as the main dish for the meal.

Among the staple food products, rice is one of the least expensive and
should appear frequently on the family bill of fare.

Thorough cooking is the secret of the tasty and easily digested dish
of cereal. Cereals in bread, muffins, cookies, cakes, croquettes, and
in casseroles with cheese, fish, or left-over meat; in the baking dish
with a slice of ham, or with a vegetable, they give variety to the menu
and make the preparation of the everyday dishes more interesting.

                                 own liquid
  Rice (Steamed)          1 c.   2 to 3 c.   45 min.
  Wheat Cereals           1 c.   2¾ c.       30 min.
  Macaroni                1 c.   2 qts.      20 min.
  Spaghetti               1 c.   2 qts.      20 min.

Stir cereals gradually into required quantity of boiling water,
allowing one teaspoon salt to each cup of cereal. Fine granular cereals
may be mixed first with a small amount of cold water to prevent
lumping, then add boiling water. Stir flaky cereals with a fork. Cook
rapidly at first over flame five or ten minutes, then in double boiler.
For prepared cereals, allow plenty of time to cook thoroughly as their
palatability and ease of digestion depend largely on this.

For variety, stir figs, dates or marmalade into cereals before serving.
Serve with canned fruits, baked apples, or fresh fruits sliced over the
cereal.

Cold cooked cereals may be sliced, dipped in flour, or in eggs and
crumbs and fried. In preparing corn meal mush for frying, a little
flour added to the corn meal will make it slice more easily.


SERVE MORE FRUITS

During the season when fruits are plentiful serve them plain, uncooked
and well ripened. Small fruits and berries should be thoroughly
chilled. All fruits should be washed and drained or wiped before
serving. To wash berries, place in a colander and pour water over them,
handling as little as possible. If washed under the faucet turn to a
small stream. Wash strawberries before removing the stems, otherwise
they will become water soaked.


CANNED FRUITS

Serve canned fruits with their juices as a dessert for luncheon and
dinner, as an appetizer for breakfast, in cocktails for dinner, and in
various desserts in which fruit is used as a base. The flavor of canned
fruit is improved by removing from the can to a dish and allowing to
stand in the air one hour before using. The juice which is not served
with the fruit should be used in fruit gelatins, sauces, or drinks. Do
not waste any fruit juice.

Certain fruit juices contain a neutral substance called pectin, which,
when properly cooked, causes them to solidify or jell. In this form
much of our excess fruit and juices are preserved. Apples, grapes,
currants, cranberries, and plums are the best known jell makers.


GRAPEFRUIT AND ORANGE

In preparing grapefruit to serve, chill the fruit thoroughly, cut in
two crosswise, remove the seeds with a sharp pointed knife, remove the
center, and, slipping the knife down between rind and pulp, loosen all
around without cutting the tissue.

BREAD MAKING

(_Also see page 40_)

Bread can be made out of flour, water, yeast, and salt, but usually
a little fat and sugar are added to give additional food value and
flavor. Milk when used in place of water makes a more nutritious bread,
and the crust has a more appetizing appearance.

Hard wheat flour, which is made from spring wheat and contains a high
percentage of gluten, is best for bread making. Winter or soft wheat
flour is used where a lighter, more flaky product is desired.


QUALITIES OF GOOD BREAD

Good bread is sometimes described as porous or containing a large
number of holes, all about the same size and shape. A loaf of bread
should be light in weight according to its size and should be elastic
and have a symmetrical form and an unbroken golden crust.


POINTS TO REMEMBER

    1. Use dependable materials and correct utensils.

    2. Cleanliness. Exactness of proportions, measuring,
    mixing and molding.

    3. Set bread to rise in a warm place. Keep it warm
    while rising.

    4. Adjust oven temperature high at first to form crust,
    then medium and steady.

    5. Cool loaves without steaming.


BAKING

Baking bread (1) kills the ferment (2) makes starch soluble (3) drives
off the alcohol and carbon dioxide (4) forms brown crust of pleasant
flavor. Bread should be baked 45 minutes-1 hour in a moderate oven at a
temperature of 350°-400°. If the oven is too hot, the crust will brown
too quickly before the center of the bread is baked. The first fifteen
minutes of the baking, the loaves should continue rising, then should
brown and continue browning for the next twenty minutes. The last
fifteen minutes should finish the baking.

After baking, the loaves should be removed from the pans at once, and
turned on their side on a wire bread or cake cooler. If a soft crust is
desired, brush with butter and cover; if a crisp crust is preferred,
allow the bread to cool without covering.


ROLLED OATS BREAD

Makes 3 loaves. Preparation 5 hours.

Pour two cups of scalded milk (or part milk and part water) over
one cup and a half of rolled oats, add two tablespoons of sugar or
molasses. When cooled to lukewarm, add one-third a cake of compressed
yeast, softened and mixed with half a cup of lukewarm water, three
cups of whole wheat flour and two of white flour. Mix with a knife to
a dough, adding as much more flour as is required to make a dough that
may be kneaded. Knead until smooth and elastic. Wash and butter the
mixing bowl; in it put the dough, carefully cover and set aside out of
draughts. When the dough is doubled in bulk, cut down and shape into
two loaves. When again nearly doubled in bulk bake one hour.

FAVORITE SOUTHERN DISHES


CREOLE SAUCE

Serves 5. Preparation 20 minutes. Medium in cost.

    2 tablespoons chopped onion
    4 tablespoons green pepper, finely chopped
    2 tablespoons oleomargarine
    2 tomatoes
    ¼ cup sliced mushrooms
    6 olives, stoned
    1⅓ cups brown sauce
    Salt and pepper

Cook onion and pepper with oleomargarine five minutes; add tomatoes,
mushrooms, and olives and cook two minutes, then add brown sauce.
Bring to boiling point and serve hot. This can accompany fish, meat or
vegetables.


SMOTHERED CHICKEN

Serves 4. Preparation 1 hour 20 minutes. Inexpensive in season.

    1 chicken
    Seasonings
    Water
    Flour
    Parsley
    1 tablespoon lard

This is a most delicate and palatable way of cooking chicken. After
cleaning the young chicken, split down the back and dredge with salt
and pepper. Put a tablespoonful of lard into the frying pan, and, when
it is hot, add the chicken. Cook over slow fire fifteen minutes, then
add a half cup of water, and set back on the stove, and let it simmer
gently and steadily for about an hour. Serve with a garnish of chopped
parsley. Some smother the chicken in butter, but this is according to
taste.


CORN FRITTERS

Serves 6. Preparation 45 minutes. Time to cook 15 minutes. Economical.

    1 can of corn
    2 eggs
    1 cupful of flour
    2 teaspoonfuls baking powder
    1 teaspoonful of salt
    ½ teaspoonful of pepper

Put the corn through a food chopper; add the well-beaten eggs, flour,
seasoning and baking powder. Mix well and fry on a well-greased hot
griddle or in deep fat.


BEATEN BISCUIT

Serves 4. Preparation 1 hour. Economical.

    2 cups flour
    1 cup milk or water
    2 tablespoons lard
    ½ teaspoonful salt

Stir the flour and add the salt, mixing thoroughly; then add the lard,
and blend by rubbing through the hands till not a lump remains in the
flour. Now add gradually the water or milk, or the milk and water
combined, using half and half of each, and knead all together till
the dough, which must not be too soft, but rather stiff, is formed.
Then lay the dough on a biscuit board on a block, and beat for a half
hour with a rolling pin. Knead lightly, and beat again for a full ten
minutes, till from every portion of the surface and sides the air
bubbles or “blisters” form. A special biscuit beater simplifies this
process. Roll to quarter of an inch thick and cut round with round
cutter, or square with a knife, and stick here and there with a fork.
Bake in a moderate oven for about ten or fifteen minutes, till a
delicate brown above and below.


SOUTHERN EGG BREAD

Serves 5. Preparation 25 minutes. Economical.

    1 quart cornmeal
    1 cup of milk (buttermilk if possible)
    2 eggs
    1 teaspoonful of salt
    2 tablespoonfuls of butter

Scald the cornmeal with boiling water, add butter, and stir. Beat the
yolks of the eggs very, very light. Add the cornmeal and melted butter
and the salt, and beat until very light, moistening with the milk. Then
add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a stiff froth. Beat all well
together. Pour into shallow tins and bake quickly. This is the real
creole corn bread, so highly praised by all tourists through Louisiana.
The secret of the exquisite flavor depends upon the proper beating of
the eggs, as well as on the rising of the corn bread itself. If the
eggs are well beaten, the corn bread will need neither soda nor baking
powder to make it rise properly. Some add a tablespoonful of sugar when
they wish to have sweetened corn bread. Corn bread, to be delicious,
should always be served hot and generously buttered.

THE POPULAR SANDWICH


    The sandwich plays such an important part in the diet
    that its food value from the standpoint of balanced
    ration is of interest. A sandwich, being composed
    of slices of bread filled with meat or fruit and
    salad dressing, constitutes a meal when coupled with
    a beverage. All food principles are present and in
    the right proportions. A sandwich embodies protein,
    carbohydrate, mineral matter and fat.

Bread for sandwiches should be twenty-four hours old. Remove all
outside crusts or not, as desired, before slicing. Slice very thin, for
sandwiches should be dainty. Always cream the butter. It not only goes
farther, but spreads more easily.

Cold sliced meats form dainty sandwiches of fine flavor. Chopped
pickles, olives, capers or other adjuncts improve meat sandwiches by
adding a tart, spicy flavor.

Butter is often mixed with creamed cheese, chopped anchovies, or
other material of like nature, to form sandwich pastes for filling.
An ordinary sized loaf of sandwich bread should make between two and
three dozen dainty sandwiches. One-half pound of butter is allowed for
spreading this number of sandwiches.

USE OF LEFT-OVERS

Waste has no place in the substantial American home. The wise home
manager uses every bit of wholesome edible product for food. She makes
tasty dishes of all left-over foods. A bit of extract of beef adds just
the flavor necessary to make many left-over meat and vegetable dishes
favorites with the family.

Left-over egg yolks are rich in fat and may be used with skimmed milk
in making custards, pudding sauces, salad dressings, noodles and in
soups or drinks. Left-over whites may be used to clear coffee, consommé
or bouillon.

Left-over bits of cheese are excellent as garnishes and as flavoring
for soups and milk sauces; they not only add a great deal of fat, but
some protein also. Cheese may be grated, added to white sauce and
served on toast. This makes a fine, tasty luncheon dish.

FEEDING THE YOUNGER GENERATION


The fundamental principle in child feeding is the gradual development
of the digestive powers.

A normal child fed upon his mother’s milk doubles in weight in the
first six months of his life, largely because his food is adapted to
his needs. Never will he double his weight so rapidly again.

Cow’s milk is the safe staple throughout the second year. Milk is
easily assimilated; its protein furnishes nitrogen in the best form
for muscle building, and its fat provides the valuable vitamines. The
mineral salts, so necessary to bone formation, are also found in this
valuable food. Great care must be exercised to maintain clean, pure
milk.

Eggs, cereals, orange juice, tomato juice, or other mild fruit juices
(a few spoonfuls at a time), round out the diet.

When the teeth are cut, stale bread or dry toast should be added to the
diet, to train the child to masticate.

When the children grow older they should be gradually given a variety
in diet and, above all, trained to eat what is put before them without
comment. Avoid monotony; children as well as adults enjoy change in the
form in which food is served.

A normal child three to four years old needs 1100-1400 calories of
food per day; at the age of five, 1435-1517 calories are required; at
the age of six, 1530-1575 calories; and at seven, 1600-1700 calories,
according to weight.

Milk and eggs continue to supply the necessary protein, even after
green vegetables are introduced, and a plain, simple dessert may be
served at the end of a meal.

Each day’s menus should contain some protective foods. Breakfast is an
important meal for the school child and should be given early so the
child is not hurried or worried by fear of being late. Many children do
poor work in school because they are not sufficiently nourished, and
frequently the meager breakfast is at fault. A regular meal schedule
should now be established and strictly adhered to. Irregularity is a
grave error in child feeding.

Milk, to the extent of a quart a day, should be continued up to the
twelfth year. Evaporated milk contains all the food properties of fresh
milk.

CARE OF FOOD IN THE HOME

_Much waste of food is due to carelessness in handling after it
is delivered in the home. Thus the benefits of the elaborate care
exercised in bringing the food to the consumer are sometimes lost by
the carelessness of the housewife._

Few of us realize the patient care and ofttimes burdensome labor
incident to food production. The long hours of labor necessary to
produce food in any form should give us a wholesome respect for it when
it comes into our kitchen all ready to form a part of the family diet.

In case of vegetable foods, the preparation of the soil, selection
of seed, the planting, care while growing, harvesting and perhaps
threshing, all demand great care and much labor upon the part of the
farmer and his family.

The food product ready, it is put to one of two uses—fed to the live
stock from which we obtain our milk, butter, cheese, meat and meat
products, or it is sent to factories where by means of much more labor
and care it is further prepared for our table. By canning, as in case
of fruits and vegetables, by milling of grains, or, if the product is a
meat animal, by the many complicated processes of packing, the food is
prepared for transportation.

Perishable foods must be cared for in cold storage and transported
in refrigerator cars, all of which occupies the time and energy of
thousands of people.

Next, the retailer adds his services, and the article which has cost
so much in money and energy is finally delivered in the home in good
condition.

It is the duty of the housewife to unpack and properly put away all
foods as soon as they are delivered.

Place butter, milk, oleomargarine, shortenings, and frying mediums,
eggs, and meat, as well as other perishables, in appropriate
receptacles and put them in the refrigerator. Meat should be unwrapped,
placed on a plate and set in the refrigerator, but never directly on
ice. Fresh salad materials should be cleaned, wiped dry, and put in a
salad bag, in a cool place.

Place cereals, syrups, coffee, tea, spices, baking powder, salt,
extracts and all canned foods upon the pantry shelf or in the
convenient kitchen cabinet.


    _Select foods carefully and use them with respect_




TO HELP THE HOSTESS


To observe the rules given for maid service when without a maid, would
be an unnecessary tax upon one’s time and strength. The serving can be
done nicely if attention be paid to certain points.

To avoid disturbance and frequent rising from the table, all foods
which the temperature of the rooms will not affect should be placed
upon the table or the serving table.

It is a good plan to have some young member of the family circle
perform what service is required. For this kind of service it is
permissible to remove plates or dishes two at a time, one in each hand,
and to leave a person without a plate. This is, of course, contrary to
conventional service.


A FEW STANDARD RULES FOR SERVING

1. Pass and place everything from the left, except beverages and extra
silver belonging on the right.

2. Place and remove plates one at a time. To save time, two plates may
be brought to the dining room. Place one on the serving table and the
other on the dining table; return to the serving table for the second
plate, rather than to the pantry.

3. Use a folded napkin in the hand under all dishes served which
contain food.

4. Use a tray only when passing or removing more than one article, as
cream and sugar, or salt and pepper.

5. In removing a course, first take all dishes containing food, then
soiled plates and silver.

6. Special watchfulness should be given by the maid that each person’s
needs are attended to.

7. Two pieces of silver placed on a platter containing food to be
served are more convenient than one, for the person serving himself.

8. No sound of preparation should come from the pantry.

9. Hot dishes must come to the table hot and served on hot plates. Cold
dishes must be cold and served on cold plates.

10. A maid should always wear a clean fresh dress and apron.


PREPAREDNESS MAKES DOING EASY

The great majority of the American housewives do their own work.

A bit of hourly help now and then is the extent of help in thousands of
representative homes.

To be able to prepare a perfect meal, have the house in order, the
children happy and spotless, the table attractively set, and to serve
the meal oneself at the same time retaining one’s poise, occupying the
hostess’ place at the table, directing the conversation and creating
a feeling of true hospitality is, perhaps, the greatest test of one’s
generalship.

These suggestions will help make the accomplishments a pleasure.


The “Day Before”

1. Plan menu and do all buying excepting fresh salad materials.

2. Prepare as much as possible of the company meal.

3. Put the house in order.

4. See that all silver, china, glassware and linen is in perfect
condition.


The “Day Of”

1. Set the children at an interesting game early in the day where they
will be free to romp. They will then want a rest at your busy time.

2. Think what a joy these guests are to be and how happy you want to
make everyone.

3. Do necessary finishing touches, arranging decorations, and rest ten
minutes, enjoying your anticipated pleasure before beginning the actual
preparation of the meal.

4. Manage a rest period of twenty minutes before dressing for dinner,
and call to mind a few amusing incidents to relate.

The ideal hostess is never tired or worried and has a fund of
interesting conversation.


THE THREE FORMS OF TABLE SERVICE

1. The Russian Service is most formal. No food is on the table except
candy and nuts. All serving is done from the pantry or the serving
table. The food is attractively arranged upon suitable dishes from
which each person helps himself; or portions may be arranged upon
plates, one of which is placed before each person. The former method is
preferable.

2. The English Service is informal. The food is placed upon the table
and served by those seated at the head and the foot. If one has a maid,
the passing is done by her; if not, by those sitting at the table.

3. The Mixed Service is a combination of the two mentioned and requires
the service of a waitress. Some of the courses are served “from the
side” (Russian), and some “from the table” (English). Frequently the
meat is served from the table and the accompanying vegetables served
from the side (Russian).


    _Manage your buying so that your guests may enjoy your
    company as well as your feasts_




FOOD VALUES


The body needs food to keep it warm, to furnish energy for the
activities of daily life; to build and repair tissue and to regulate
the body process.

Proteins, fats, carbohydrates, mineral matter, and water, are the chief
classes of food. The chief work of proteins is to build and repair
tissue. Meat and milk are the principal sources of protein. Nuts,
vegetables and some cereals also supply this element.

Carbohydrates are the starches and sugars. They are found in
vegetables, cereals, and fruits and give heat and energy to the body.
Fats give two and a half times as much energy as any other food.

Mineral matters enter into the composition of the body tissues and
blood. They act as regulators, preserving the alkalinity of the body.
They are found in varying proportions in all foods, but milk contains
all the essential ones.

Vitamines are necessary for growth and are abundant in leafy vegetables
and milk. Foods rich in vitamine content are known as protective foods.
They prevent the development of deficiency and old age diseases.

Water is necessary as a carrier and regulator. It aids digestion,
removes waste, and keeps the temperature normal.


Balanced Rations

A general balance of food should be maintained in each day’s diet:
1/5th meat or meat alternatives, 1/5th fat, and 3/5ths carbohydrates,
with a serving of fruits and vegetables and plenty of liquid, completes
the necessary variety.


WHERE THE CALORIE COMES IN

Before assimilation, the food we eat must be oxidized or burned. The
heat resulting from this oxidation is measured in terms of calories, or
heat units.

While the number of calories supplied by the diet is important, the
proper balance as to the classification of the food is of prime
importance. We cannot build up the diet on calorie values alone without
consideration of the food elements.


Rubner’s Chart of Calorie Requirements

  Man at light work          2500 to 2800 Calories per day
  Man at moderate work       3000 to 3500    “      “   “
  Man at very hard work      4000 to 5000    “      “   “
  Woman at light work        1800 to 2400    “      “   “
  Woman at moderate work     2400 to 2800    “      “   “
  Child from two to six      1200 to 1800    “      “   “
  Child from six to fifteen  1800 to 2500    “      “   “
  Aged Man                   1800 to 2000    “      “   “
  Aged Woman                 1600 to 1800    “      “   “

(The above is computed on persons of average weights.)


PROTECTIVE FOODS

The responsibility for the correct development of a family rests more
and more surely at the door of the one who plans and cooks the meals
for that family.

Nutrition experts are continually making careful tests and giving
us valuable information through the newspapers and women’s national
publications. With such easy access to the fundamentals of correct
eating, it comes close to criminal negligence for a mother to feed her
family improperly; the present percentage of under-nourished children
is appalling, and many of these are in the homes of the well-to-do.

The most important “food finding” of the year has been the information
given the public regarding Protective Foods, sometimes called dietetic
ferments or the foods rich in the vitamines that promote growth and
those rich in the vitamines that protect one from deficiency diseases
such as scurvy, beriberi, pellagra and less dangerous skin diseases.

Milk and its products, butter and cheese, are foremost growth
promotors. In this class comes also the yolk of eggs, glandular meats,
and grains with the living germ still intact. Leafy vegetables, such
as spinach, lettuce, cabbage, chard, cauliflower, kale, all greens,
water cress, onions, string beans, and a few others are classed with
protective foods.

While Professor McCullom does not yet definitely list the tomato under
protective foods, it is found to have valuable protective qualities,
often being substituted for orange juice in preventing scurvy in baby
feeding. The protective substance of the tomato is not easily destroyed.

Experiments are continually being completed which add new foods to this
important group.

TIME TABLES WEIGHTS AND MEASURES

Accurate measuring of materials, heat and time are primary factors in
successful cooking. Every kitchen should have a weighing scale and a
measuring cup.

TIME AND TEMPERATURE

It will not be long before thermometers will be generally used as
kitchen appliances. Until then we must show how we may know when a food
is cooked, instead of stating the exact number of minutes required. It
is better in most cases to subject foods to a moderate heat for a long
time, than to intense heat for a shorter period. The shape and size of
the article to be cooked and the variety and age of fruit or vegetables
must be considered.

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
